This file is for an arduino light sensor that uses an arduino photoresistor to measure light values and based on that certain actions are made. Some actions incleda a buzzer (if there is too much light), an rgb led (to indicate all diffent modes), and the lcd (does pretty much the same thing as the rgb led)

Notes
- When LED is white = there is not enough light and the led is turned on to brighten it u
- When LED is not on = there is enough light to be sustained
- when LED is red = there is too much light and the buzzer will sound
